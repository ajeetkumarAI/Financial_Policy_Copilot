    "# 📑 GenAI Powered Financial Policy Assistant — End-to-End Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💼 1. Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In banks, insurance firms, and financial institutions, professionals face **thousands of pages of compliance manuals, regulatory filings, and internal policy documents**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Searching manually wastes time and increases compliance risk.  \n",
    "- Misinterpretation can lead to **multi-million dollar fines**.  \n",
    "- Employees and auditors need **instant access to precise, policy-based answers**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project solves that problem by creating an AI assistant that ingests **financial policy PDFs**, converts them into embeddings, and answers questions strictly based on those documents — ensuring compliance and reducing risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌍 2. Why This Problem Is Important\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Financial regulations = 1000s of pages** (Basel III, IFRS, SEC filings, RBI circulars, etc.)  \n",
    "- Manual searching is **slow and error-prone**  \n",
    "- **Time-critical decisions** in audits, reporting, and client onboarding  \n",
    "- **Accuracy is non-negotiable** — hallucinations = fines, lawsuits, reputational damage  \n",
    "- Staff are often non-technical → need **natural language Q&A**  \n",
    "\n",
    "👉 “This AI tool democratizes access to financial compliance knowledge, reduces manual effort, and minimizes regulatory risk.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 3. Challenges Solved\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge 1 — Long, unstructured financial documents**  \n",
    "- PDFs contain dense legal text, tables of thresholds, irregular formatting, and no metadata.  \n",
    "- ✅ Solution: **OpenAI embedding models** convert text chunks into vector representations stored in Vector Store. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge 2 — Accuracy in compliance domain**  \n",
    "- LLMs must not hallucinate.  \n",
    "- ✅ Solution: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) ensures answers are grounded in the uploaded policies only.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge 3 — Strict document-only answers**  \n",
    "- No external knowledge allowed.  \n",
    "- ✅ Solution: Query pipeline enforces grounding in embeddings, with citations from source PDFs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge 4 — Fast inference at scale**  \n",
    "- Compliance queries often happen under audit pressure.  \n",
    "- ✅ Solution: OpenAI LLMs provide low-latency, high-quality responses.  \n",

    "Absolutely — here’s a **polished 2–3 minute spoken pitch script** you can use in interviews. It’s conversational, flows naturally, and hits all the key points from the document without sounding like you’re reading slides.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🎤 Sample Pitch Script\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"Let me walk you through a project I built — a Financial Policy Assistant. In large banks and insurance firms, professionals deal with thousands of pages of compliance manuals, regulatory filings, and internal policy documents. Searching them manually is slow, error-prone, and risky. A single misinterpretation can lead to multi‑million dollar fines. So the problem I wanted to solve was: how do we give auditors, compliance officers, and financial staff instant, accurate access to the right policy information?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"The solution I designed was a GenAI-powered assistant that ingests financial policy PDFs, converts them into embeddings using OpenAI’s embedding models, and stores them in a vector database. When a user asks a question — say, ‘What is the minimum liquidity coverage ratio under Basel III?’ — the query is embedded, matched against the stored chunks, and the most relevant sections are retrieved. Those chunks are then passed into GPT‑4, which generates a grounded answer strictly based on the uploaded documents, with citations for auditability.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"From a technical perspective, I built a FastAPI backend with endpoints for document upload, preprocessing, embedding, and querying. The frontend is a Streamlit app that provides a simple chatbot interface where users can upload documents and ask questions. The whole system is deployed on Azure Web App, with Blob Storage for raw PDFs and Key Vault for secure API key management. I also experimented with different document loaders — for PDFs, Word docs, CSVs — and multiple chunking strategies, like semantic chunking by headings and table‑aware chunking for compliance thresholds.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"The impact is significant: instead of spending hours searching through dense manuals, staff can get instant, citation‑backed answers in seconds. This reduces compliance risk, improves audit readiness, and empowers non‑technical staff to interact with complex policies in plain English. In short, it’s not just a chatbot — it’s a compliance intelligence platform that democratizes access to financial policy knowledge.\"*\n",
