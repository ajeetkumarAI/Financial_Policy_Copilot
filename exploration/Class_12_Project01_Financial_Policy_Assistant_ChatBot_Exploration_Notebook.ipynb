Jasmina Haynes (CEO) \\n2. Siobhan Turner (Trustee) \\n3. Gail Klintworth (Board chair) \\n \\nBank accounts may be accessed on line via hsbc.net. The following people have access: \\n1. Britto Bernadet (Finance and Compliance Manager) – System administrator: prepare and \\napprove payments \\n2. Jasmina Haynes (CEO) –  System administrator: prepare and approve payments \\n3.

Baduwah MacArthur (Finance and Governance Assistant) – System administrator: \\nprepare payments only \\n \\nAll bank accounts are reconciled to the accounting system at least monthly and the month-end \\nreconciliation is reviewed by an independent person, typically the Finance and Compliance \\nManager.   \\n3.

Fixed assets  \\nAll assets costing more than £3,000 and with an expected useful life exceeding one year are \\ncapitalised.  \\nDepreciation is charged annually at the following rates in order to write off assets over their \\nuseful economic life:  \\n● Computer equipment: 50% per annum \\n● Fixtures and fittings: 50% per annum \\n \\nAn inventory of all assets held is maintained by the finance team. This includes all assets and \\nequipment regardless of whether they are classified as fixed assets for accounting purposes. \\nThe inventory is used to monitor the whereabouts of assets (e.g. computers) and for insurance \\npurposes.  \\nStaff are responsible for any physical assets assigned to them.  Staff must report loss or \\ndamage of any asset to the Head of Finance, Technology Manager and/or CEO as soon as \\npossible.   \\n5. Debtors, creditors, accruals and prepayments \\nTypically the only debtors are donors and customers. Outstanding amounts are monitored at \\nleast monthly by the Finance and Compliance Manager.    \\nThe only creditors are trade creditors. They are paid in line with stated payment terms.  \\nAccruals and prepayments are posted monthly and reviewed annually as part of the year-end \\nprocess. \\n6. Income  \\nIncome is recognised when the charity is legally entitled to it, receipt is probable and the \\namount can be reliably measured.  \\nInvestment income is recognised on a receivable basis. \\nDonations in kind (e.g. pro bono support by professionals) must be recorded by notifying the \\nFinance and Compliance Manager who will record them in the finance folders.   \\nNo income is received in cash or by cheque.  \\n7. Procurement policy \\nProcurement is the purchase of works, assets, goods and services for the organisation. It is \\none of the most risky areas in NGO financial management as it is often abused by kickbacks, \\npaying too much for sub-standard goods, or buying from related parties. \\nThe objectives of this policy are to ensure that: \\n● The correct goods or services are purchased, in terms of the correct quality and \\nspecification.'),\n",

However, in buying or commissioning goods and services, \\nIntegrity Action must conduct itself in a fair, open and transparent manner in accordance with \\nthe following principles:  \\n● Value for money is achieved; this takes into account quality, timing, ethics and \\nenvironmental considerations as well as cost.  \\n● Competition - procurement should be through open competition unless there are \\nexceptional reasons.  \\n● Conflicts of interest – any real or perceived conflict of interest is declared in line with \\nthe conflicts of interest policy.  \\n● Payment on time - suppliers must be paid on time in accordance with contractual \\narrangements.  \\n● Ethical standards - procurement must be undertaken to highest ethical standards, and \\nfairness to suppliers.  \\n● Legal aspects - contracts must be in writing (email is fine) and be fair and non-\\ndiscriminatory.  \\n● Environmental impact - suppliers must consider environmental impacts and aim to \\nminimise adverse effects. \\n● Local – goods and services should be procured from local sources when possible, but \\nwithout compromising competition. \\nProcedures  \\n1. Prepare the specification for the goods/service to be procured. \\n2. Check the available budget. \\n3. Obtain authorisation from the appropriate person (see Delegated authority limits) to go \\nahead with the procurement. \\n4. Obtain quotes according to the following criteria.   \\n \\nValue of purchase \\nincluding VAT\\nAction required\\n£2,500 and under\\nMinimum of 1 quote\\n£2,501 - £7,500\\nMinimum of 2 written quotes\\n£7,501 - £15,000\\nMinimum of 3 written quotes\\nGreater than £15,000\\nFormal tender required (i.e. \\nrequest for tenders published and \\nadvertised appropriately)'),\n",

Ensure donor guidelines are followed as each donor has different requirements in this \\narea. If the limits are lower than above the donor guidelines take precedence.   \\n6. To identify potential suppliers ask colleagues for contacts, search online or advertise \\nas appropriate. If the supplier is related/known to the person running the procurement \\nprocess, this must be declared and a second opinion must be obtained before \\ncommitting to the purchase (see conflicts of interest policy).  \\n7. Ensure the quoted cost is within budget (and that the budget is monitored before, \\nduring and after the procurement process).  \\n8. Select the supplier based on the principles above. The decision must be made in line \\nwith delegated authority limits and the rationale for the decision must be documented.   \\n9. When goods are received ensure that they are of the correct quality and quantity.  \\n10. Send the invoice to finance@integrityaction.org in line with normal finance procedures.   \\n11. For repeatable, short term contracts a ‘bank’ of reliable suppliers will be maintained on \\nwhom suitable due diligence, in line with the above, has been carried out. These \\npreferred suppliers can be asked to quote in line with the above guidelines, and then \\ncontracts awarded in a more timely manner.  A review of these suppliers should be \\nconducted at least every 18 months to ensure they still comply with the above \\nprinciples. \\nChoice of currency  \\nWhere the purchase is not in the UK and there is a choice of currency, the following guidelines \\nshould be followed (in order of preference):  \\n1. Use the same currency as the underlying funds are physically received in (i.e. not \\nnecessarily the currency per the donor contract) to minimise exchange rate risk. \\n2. If not possible/practical, use GBP. \\n3. If not possible/practical use USD.  \\n4. If not possible/practical use currency of country expenditure takes place in. \\n8. Expenditure processing \\nAll payments are made by bank transfer, credit card, cash or on occasion Western Union.  \\nWestern Union may be used for payments up to £2,000. Western Union is used when bank \\ntransfers have failed and the recipient agrees.  \\nWe do not use cheque books.   \\nPolicies and procedures in relation to credit cards, staff advances and staff expenses are \\ncovered in the Travel and Expenses policy and procedures.      \\nApprovals process \\nFor all approvals (i.e. payments/expenses/credit cards) the process is as follows:  \\n● The requester emails the approver attaching the supporting documents (e.g. invoice, \\ncontract/agreement, bank details) and including the details in the table below: \\n \\nGrant'),\n",

Any uncovered costs must be met from reserves; therefore in order to be a financially \\nsustainable organisation full cost recovery must be achieved.    \\n \\n(2) What are our costs? \\nOur costs fall into two broad categories:  \\n \\n● Direct costs of project implementation  \\nE.g. grants to partners, translation of Development Check, travel to monitor the \\nproject, in-country coordinator etc. \\nThese costs must always be fully covered by the grant/project budget.  \\n● Indirect costs (also called central, core, fixed or support costs or overheads) \\nThese are difficult to apportion to a particular project/grant.  \\nE.g. UK salaries, office rent and other office costs, Development Check maintenance.  \\nA portion of these costs must be allocated to every grant/project. See the guidelines \\nbelow.  \\n  \\n(3) How do we ensure that all our indirect costs are covered? \\nFinance team actions \\n● As part of the annual budget setting process the achievement of full cost recovery is \\nreviewed and the plan for the forthcoming year is set – this is linked to the reserves \\npolicy as any costs which are not recovered must be met from reserves. At the start of \\nthe year it is common for a portion of indirect costs to be unmet as we assume that new \\nfunding sources will be found throughout the year. The trustees take a view of the \\ndegree of risk they are willing to take in this area.  \\n● On a quarterly basis the proportion of costs recovered is monitored against the \\nbudgeted position (as part of reserves monitoring).  \\nNon-finance team actions \\nWhen committing to expenditure ensure that it is included in a donor budget. Do not approve \\nunbudgeted expenditure.  \\nWhen preparing donor budgets we must balance the need to be competitive/fundable and to \\nnot exceed the donor’s overhead limits with our need to cover all our costs. To do this the \\nfollowing guidelines must be followed:  \\n● Ensure that all project related costs are included in the budget for activities (and not \\nlabelled as overheads). This includes:  \\no An element of CEO salary costs for oversight and reporting;  \\no An element of finance team salaries for financial reporting; \\no Travel costs for negotiations, training and monitoring; \\no A contribution to Development Check maintenance;'),\n",

Fixed assets  \\nAll assets costing more than £3,000 and with an expected useful life exceeding one year are \\ncapitalised.  \\nDepreciation is charged annually at the following rates in order to write off assets over their \\nuseful economic life:  \\n● Computer equipment: 50% per annum \\n● Fixtures and fittings: 50% per annum \\n \\nAn inventory of all assets held is maintained by the finance team. This includes all assets and \\nequipment regardless of whether they are classified as fixed assets for accounting purposes. \\nThe inventory is used to monitor the whereabouts of assets (e.g. computers) and for insurance \\npurposes.  \\nStaff are responsible for any physical assets assigned to them.  Staff must report loss or \\ndamage of any asset to the Head of Finance, Technology Manager and/or CEO as soon as \\npossible.   \\n5. Debtors, creditors, accruals and prepayments \\nTypically the only debtors are donors and customers. Outstanding amounts are monitored at \\nleast monthly by the Finance and Compliance Manager.    \\nThe only creditors are trade creditors. They are paid in line with stated payment terms.  \\nAccruals and prepayments are posted monthly and reviewed annually as part of the year-end \\nprocess. \\n6. Income  \\nIncome is recognised when the charity is legally entitled to it, receipt is probable and the \\namount can be reliably measured.  \\nInvestment income is recognised on a receivable basis. \\nDonations in kind (e.g. pro bono support by professionals) must be recorded by notifying the \\nFinance and Compliance Manager who will record them in the finance folders.   \\nNo income is received in cash or by cheque.  \\n7. Procurement policy \\nProcurement is the purchase of works, assets, goods and services for the organisation. It is \\none of the most risky areas in NGO financial management as it is often abused by kickbacks, \\npaying too much for sub-standard goods, or buying from related parties. \\nThe objectives of this policy are to ensure that: \\n● The correct goods or services are purchased, in terms of the correct quality and \\nspecification.')"
